WHAT

This repository rebuilds parts of Makehuman 0.9.1-rc1a in Typescript.
WHY

To learn how this version of Makehuman worked so it's features can be incooperated
into makehuman.js, which is based on Makehuman 1.2.0.

It seems that instead of a skeleton with bones, rotation is done with a kind of morphs?
